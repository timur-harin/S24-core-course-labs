# Lab 1 flutter web app

## Why Flutter was chosen for the assignment?

- Flutter was chosen for its ability to quickly create beautiful and high-performance applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- Its hot reload feature allows for rapid iteration and development.
- Flutter's widget-based architecture provides a flexible and customizable UI design.
- It has a strong community support, extensive documentation, and a wide range of packages and libraries available.

## Best Practices in Flutter
Flutter, like any other framework, has its own set of best practices to follow in order to maintain a clean and efficient codebase. Some of the best practices in Flutter include:

1. Using State Management: It is important to choose an appropriate state management approach, such as Provider, Bloc, or Riverpod, to efficiently manage the state of the application and prevent unnecessary UI rerenders.
2. Code Readability and Standards: By following Dart's style guide and effective use of widgets, developers can maintain a clean, readable, and consistent codebase, leading to improved code quality and maintainability in Flutter development.
3. Modular design principles: The division into feature modules, UI components, data layers, and services follows modular design principles, allowing for better organization, reusability, and separation of concerns. This approach helps to maintain a clean and efficient codebase, with clear responsibilities for different parts of the application.
4. Using Navigator 2.0: Flutter's Navigator 2.0 enables deep linking, dynamic routing, and better management of navigation stacks, making it easier to manage and scale the application. By using Navigator 2.0, developers can create a structured and scalable navigation flow, leading to a more maintainable codebase.
5. Implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD): By writing unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests, developers can ensure the reliability and quality of their Flutter applications. TDD helps in achieving better code coverage, identifying bugs early, and ensuring that the app behaves as expected.

By following these best practices, developers can ensure that their Flutter applications are well-structured, maintainable, and scalable, leading to a better overall development experience and a more robust final product.
